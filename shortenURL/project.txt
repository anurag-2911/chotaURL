Basic Implementation:

1. UI in react will make request to the golang backend to get short URL.
2. Short URL is returned to the react UI application.
3. Using the short URI, react application gets the actual long uri.
4. React App is hosted in one docker container.
5. Go server is hosted in another docker container.
6. Docker-Compose is used to start both the container.
7. Kubernetes is used to manage both the container.

Next Level Requirements:
1. Database implementation.
2. Caching implementation.
3. Load balancer and multiple instances of backend servers.
4. Production grade UI. 

Next Level Requirements:
1. Deployment of Dockers and Kubernetes to AWS.
2. Millions of requests per second.
3. Database partitioning.
4. Cache optimization.
5. Application optimization.
6. Kubernetes optimization.
7. Kafka Implementation.

Next Level Implementation:
1. Concurrency in golang.
2. React best practices.
3. DSA using golang.
4. Advance DB concepts.
